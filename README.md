# Mute Discord for Alfred

Mute Discord with a global hotkey without giving the app ‘Input Monitoring’ permission

Download the workflow from the release [page](https://github.com/Sponge-bink/alfred-mute-discord/releases/), double click to install it in Alfred. Choose your favourite hotkey or keyword by editing the ‘Hotkey’ ‘Keyword’ object. And the workflows is ready to use.

*Note: The Discord macOS app has a default mute hotkey of ⌘⇧M. But in order to use it globally you have to give the Discord app input monitoring permissions in System Settings. It even requires input monitoring permission (but does not ask you for it!) to even record your custom hotkey. And worse, all hotkeys become global ones once the permission is granted and cannot be disabled. I don't feel comfortable giving the app that permission so I created this workflow.*
